# imgprmt

Use the command-line tool ***imgprmt*** to embed an AI image ***text prompt*** within a ***JPG*** image file.  

The program outputs a separate ***JPG+HTML*** polyglot image file. You can then share the image on a number of social media sites, such as ***X/Twitter***, ***Tumblr***, ***Mastodon***, ***Flickr***, etc.  

These platforms will retain the embedded prompt, so that it's available to anyone who downloads your image.   

![Demo Image](https://github.com/CleasbyCode/imgprmt/blob/main/demo_image/demo_image4.jpg)  

To correctly download images from ***X/Twitter***, click the image in the post to ***fully expand*** it, before saving.  
View the embedded prompt as a basic web page by renaming the ***.jpg*** file extension to ***.htm***

Image Description: In a grand yet dilapidated mansion interior with intricate wooden wall panelling
and a majestic staircase, an eerie, imposing figure standing on the stairs, lunges forward.<br><br>
This character is a blend of historical and fantastical elements, wearing a mask that evokes the textures
of burlap and bandages, accentuated with metal rivets and a sinister, grill-like mouthpiece.<br><br>
The eyes behind the mask are obscured by a cross-hatch pattern, enhancing its mysterious aura.
The attire is composed of ragged, earth-toned fabrics, suggesting a bygone era or a post-apocalyptic world.
<br><br>In one hand, it holds a blade, stained with blood, while the other hand reaches out toward the viewer
with a bloodied finger, threateningly pointed. The settingâ€™s opulence clashes with the figure's menace, creating
a stark juxtaposition between the lavish environment and the character's foreboding presence.
<br><br>The lighting casts dramatic shadows, emphasizing the cinematic quality of the scene.
Cinematic and photographic styles. --ar 16:9
