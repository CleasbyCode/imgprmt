Imgprmt v1.6 (Windows CLI Edition). Created by Nicholas Cleasby (@CleasbyCode) 25/05/2023.
		
This program enables you to insert a prompt/description for your AI images within a JPG image file.
		
The program will create a JPG / HTML polyglot file.
		
Your prompt text is saved within a basic HTML page embedded within the image, that you can view by renaming
the ".jpg" file extension to a ".htm" extension.

The image works with Twitter, Mastodon, Tumblr, Flickr and *Bluesky. 

This means the image can be shared on these platforms & it will retain the embedded HTML page with your prompt text.
